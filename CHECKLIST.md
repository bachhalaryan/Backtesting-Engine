# Industry-Grade Backtester Feature Checklist

This document outlines the features required to elevate the backtesting engine to an industry-grade system. The current engine is a strong foundation, but requires significant enhancements in the following areas to be considered professional-grade.

---

### Tier 1: Critical "Must-Have" Features

*These are the most critical features that are absolute requirements for accurate and reliable backtesting.*

-   [ ] **Corporate Actions Handling:**
    -   [ ] **Splits:** Automatically adjust historical price and volume data for stock splits to prevent massive data errors.
    -   [ ] **Dividends:** Adjust historical prices for cash dividends or add dividend payments to the portfolio's cash balance.
    -   [ ] **Mergers & Acquisitions:** Handle symbol changes, delistings, and other M&A events.

-   [ ] **Realistic Execution Simulation:**
    -   [ ] **Liquidity Modeling:** Simulate the inability to fill a large order at a single price. Model fills across multiple price levels based on available volume.
    -   [ ] **Market Impact:** Model how large trades affect the market price, leading to more realistic slippage.
    -   [ ] **Latency Modeling:** Simulate the time delay between signal generation, order placement, and fill confirmation.

-   [ ] **Scalability and Performance:**
    -   [ ] **Vectorized Backtesting:** Implement a fully vectorized core loop (using NumPy/Pandas) for high-speed testing of non-path-dependent strategies.
    -   [ ] **Efficient Data Storage:** Migrate from CSV files to a more efficient storage solution like HDF5, Parquet, or a dedicated time-series database for fast, indexed data retrieval.

### Tier 2: Advanced Features and Robustness

*These features build on the core, providing the advanced capabilities expected in a professional environment.*

#### Data Handling and Management
-   [ ] **Multi-Timeframe Analysis:** Ability to request and synchronize data from different timeframes (e.g., weekly, daily, hourly) within a single strategy.
-   [ ] **Data Cleaning & Validation:** A pre-processing pipeline to handle missing data, outliers, and errors in raw data feeds.
-   [ ] **Support for Diverse Data Types:**
    -   [ ] Fundamental Data (earnings, revenue, etc.).
    -   [ ] Alternative Data (news sentiment, etc.).
    -   [ ] Options & Derivatives Data.

#### Portfolio and Risk Management
-   [ ] **Hierarchical Portfolio Management:** Support for managing capital and risk across a portfolio of multiple strategies.
-   [ ] **Advanced Cost Modeling:**
    -   [ ] **Financing Costs:** Model the cost of holding leveraged or short positions overnight.
    -   [ ] **Tax Modeling:** Calculate the impact of short-term and long-term capital gains taxes.
-   [ ] **Sophisticated Risk Controls:**
    -   [ ] Portfolio-level concentration limits (by asset, sector, etc.).
    -   [ ] Factor exposure monitoring and limits (e.g., to market beta).
    -   [ ] Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations and limits.

#### Strategy and Analysis Tooling
-   [ ] **Parameter Optimization Suite:** Tools for running thousands of backtests to find optimal strategy parameters (e.g., Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization).
-   [ ] **Walk-Forward Analysis:** A framework for testing a strategy's robustness on out-of-sample data to prevent overfitting.
-   [ ] **Richer Statistical Analysis:**
    -   [ ] Sortino Ratio, Omega Ratio, Tail Ratios.
    -   [ ] Detailed trade-level and PnL distribution analysis.
-   [ ] **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Allow strategies to adjust position sizes based on market volatility or other dynamic factors.

#### Technical and Operational Infrastructure
-   [ ] **External Configuration Management:** All backtest parameters should be defined in external configuration files (e.g., YAML) for automation and reproducibility.
-   [ ] **Robust Logging and Auditing:** Implement structured, detailed logging for every event, order, and state change for debugging and auditing.
-   [ ] **Seamless Live Trading Transition:**
    -   [ ] Live data handler implementations for broker APIs.
    -   [ ] Live execution handlers with robust error handling for real-world trading complexities.
