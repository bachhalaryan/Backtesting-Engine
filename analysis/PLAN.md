# Data Analysis Framework Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for building a new data analysis and research framework alongside the existing backtesting engine.

## 1. Core Modules

The framework will be built inside the `analysis` directory and will consist of the following core modules:

-   **`data_manager.py`**: A powerful and flexible data handler for fetching, slicing, and filtering financial data from various sources.
-   **`timeseries.py`**: A toolkit for time series analysis, including common financial indicators, statistical tests, and plotting utilities.
-   **`ml.py`**: A module for feature engineering, machine learning model training, and walk-forward validation.

## 2. Development Steps

1.  **Create `analysis` Directory**: Isolate the new framework from the core backtesting engine. (Done)
2.  **Build `DataManager`**: Implement the initial version of `analysis/data_manager.py` with support for loading data from local CSV files.
3.  **Write Unit Tests**: Create `tests/test_analysis.py` to ensure the `DataManager` works as expected. All new functionality will be tested.
4.  **Develop Time Series Toolkit**: Build out functions for technical analysis and statistics.
5.  **Implement ML Module**: Add capabilities for machine learning research.
6.  **Create Example Notebook**: Provide a `example_analysis.ipynb` to demonstrate the usage of the framework.
7.  **Regular Commits**: Commit changes frequently after each logical step is completed and tested.
